## Risk-Aware Portfolio Optimization with Transformer Attention

To run the code, you will need access to a GPU. I used Google Colab. Then, you'll need to run: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may need to set up a custom virtual environment for this. Then, follow the instructions in the [notebook](portfolio_optimization.ipynb) to run it for yourself.
